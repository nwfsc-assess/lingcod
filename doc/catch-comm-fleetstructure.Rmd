The fleet structure for commercial landings included two fleets,
trawl (TW) and fixed gear (FG).
Trawl landings included information from
bottom trawls, shrimp trawls, net gear, and dredging activities.
Landings from all other gear types, mainly hook and line,
were assigned to FG.
This fleet structure matches the fleet structure used in the
previous assessment.
