Recreational fishery length (Figures \ref{fig:wa-lencomp-sexed}, \ref{fig:wa-lencomp-unsexed}, \ref{fig:or-lencomp-sexed}, \ref{fig:or-lencomp-unsexed}, \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-sexed}, and \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-unsexed}) and age compositions (Figures \ref{fig:wa-agecomp-sexed}, \ref{fig:wa-agecomp-unsexed}, \ref{fig:or-agecomp-sexed}, \ref{fig:or-agecomp-unsexed}) were obtained directly from \gls{wdfw} and \gls{odfw}, and from \gls{mrfss} for years 1980 - 2003 and from \gls{crfs} for years 2004 - 2020 from the \gls{recfin} website for California. Note that, in consultation with \gls{wdfw} and \gls{odfw}ODFW representatives, it was determined that the state databases were more reliable so the data were not obtained via \gls{recfin} (\gls{mrfss}) for Washington and Oregon. Lengths from \gls{wdfw} with designation of total length (n = 591) were converted to fork length using the conversions of @laidig_lingcod_conversions_1997. Lengths of fish in California, measured by samplers onboard \glspl{cpfv} prior to being released (Type 3d data) were also obtained from 2003 to 2020. Annual recreational length- and age-composition distributions were developed for each state for which observations were available, following the same bin structure as was used for data from fishery-independent sources. Length and age compositions were applied for male, female, and unsexed fish, though the number of samples of unsexed aged fish was small. Many of these composition data lack information on the number of fish sampled out of those landed in a given trip, and therefore composition data are used without expansion to the sample level. Unexpanded recreational composition data are commonly used in West Coast stock assessments for the above reason. Sample sizes used in the model were therefore set at the number of fish sampled for each year and data set. Table \ref{tab:sample-size-length} show the sample sizes for lengths, and Table \ref{tab:sample-size-age} the sample sizes for ages. Conditional-length-at-age distributions were also applied for the recreational fleets for Washington and Oregon and explored within the model as a sensitivity.  

Only landed fish were included in composition data. Fish designated as released were excluded from the length and age compositions. This occurred for 2,920 samples, which represent approximately 2 percent of the total samples.  

In Oregon the minimum size limits for `r spp` have changed from 22 inches during 1995 to 1997 and 2006 to present, but were 24 inches during 1998 to 2006. It has also been reported that recreational fishers in Oregon sometimes release large, assumed to be female fish, so that they can spawn. However other anglers tend to target and retain these large fish. Recreational length samples from ODFW were obtained from three sources: \gls{mrfss}, \gls{recfin} (\gls{orbs}) and \gls{odfw} special project sampling. From 1980 – 1989 and from 1993 – 2000, the MRFSS program collected samples from ocean areas only (n = 8,769). ODFW provided MRFSS samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values; however, sample size was limited and therefore, imputed lengths were used. From 1980 – 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by MRFSS, which were converted to fork length. From 1993 – 2000, fork length (mm) was collected. Length samples from 2001 – 2020 from the ORBS sampling program are available on RecFIN (n =105,197). All \gls{orbs} samples are by fork length (mm). All samples are from ocean trips. Special projects samples collected by \gls{odfw} staff from the recreational fishery are provided from 2001 (n = 72) but were not used in the length compositions for the assessment model. There were 8,491 Oregon recreational age samples available from 1999 – 2008 and 2012 – 2019 on \gls{recfin} (extracted on 04/14/2021). Approximately, 50.5% of samples were males (n = 4,288) and 49.4% were females (n = 4,193).  There were 10 unsexed samples (0.1%). The majority of these samples are from the central Oregon coast (n = 4,440), including Newport (18.7%), Garibaldi (18.6%) and Depoe Bay (15.0%), followed by Brookings on the south coast (27.3%, n = 2,321).
