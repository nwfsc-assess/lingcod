#### Fin rays from \glsentrylong{cdfw}

The \gls{cdfw} collected `r utils_name("common")` fin rays from the
commercial and recreational fisheries in recent years and cleaned them in
preparation for ageing.
Sampling occurred from
February through June 2019 between Crescent City and Santa Barbara, California.
Samples were aquired for priority species, not just `r utils_name("common")`.
In total, 113 `r utils_name("common")` fin rays were collected.
The majority of samples were landed utilizing hook-and-line gear,
though some trawl-caught samples were also obtained.
Meta data for these samples includes
port of landing, gear type, length, weight, sex, and maturity.

Unfortunately, restricted access to ageing laboratories because of the COVID-19 pandemic
made it nearly impossible to finish ageing even routinely-aged collections.
Sectioning and mounting the fin rays typically requires a hood and ventilation,
which limited the options for alternative laboratory space.
The fin rays collected by \gls{cdfw} are adequately preserved and can still be aged at a later date
allowing for future exploration of this data source.

In 2017, \gls{cdfw} began opportunistically collecting
filleted groundfish carcasses from the recreational fishery to increase recreational
biological data.
Samples were collected in a partnership with \gls{cpfv} operators and
at public fillet stations, launch ramps, and piers.
Current efforts have been primarily focused in the Crescent City and Monterey Bay
port complexes as well as samples from south of Point Conception in
collaboration with the Sportfishing Association of California, yielding a
total of 324 `r utils_name("common")` fin rays.  In addition to age
structures, meta data includes port of landing, carcass length, and sex
when it can be determined from the filleted carcass. A graduate student at
California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo is working on a study of
total length to carcass length for recreational species, including rockfish
and `r utils_name("common")`, results of which will help inform the best
treatment of length information attained from carcasses.
These samples could be included in future assessments potentially as
conditional age-at-length compositions or as marginal compositions.
Both types of data are helpful for estimating growth and selectivity patterns.
