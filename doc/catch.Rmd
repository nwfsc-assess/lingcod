# Working directory: in doc, e.g., lingcod_2021\doc
# rmarkdown::render("catch.Rmd")
# Results are saved in ..\data-raw\catch.RData
#
# TO DO
# 1. Add source to the commercial catch stream
# 2. standardize catch versus landing
# 3. Assign fleet numbers and fleet names
# 4. write a function to format data_catch into SS.dat format
# 5. create a figure showing similarities of composition data from OR and
# northern CA recreational landings
# 7. Think about splitting catch_comm_CA_CALCOM ERK into area
# where right now it is all going to the North
# 9. for catch_rec_2000 maybe assign only a portion of Redwood
# from early years to the north model
# 9. Add variable at top for scrollable tables to either be included or omitted
# and create a table for every data set. these can then be included if we want
# or omitted when making the final .md file that we will source.
#
# PIE IN THE SKY
# 1. Why are WDFW 1995 to 1981 landings different than those in PacFIN
# MH (2017) noted that no one at WDFW knew why and that Phil was going to investigate?
# 2. Reconstructions using Sette and Fiedler for other species,
# JF noted data-based reconstructions may be better than a linear ramp
# 3. Recreational catch: MODE, how party boat vs. private boat landings differ
# 4. inquire to WDFW if reconstruction includes tribal catches via
# https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2017/03/i2_att1_catch_reconstruction_workshop_report_mar2017bb.pdf/
# 5. Create a file name syntax with attributes to store who provided the file
# and perhaps other metadata that would be useful for latex text in the document,
# e.g., citation, date provided.

#### Reconstruction of commercial landings

```{asis, catch-comm-WA-text, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
##### Washington commercial reconstruction

The reconstruction of commercial landings for coastal waters off of Washington
was provided by \gls{wdfw}.
This reconstruction included landings starting in
`r min(catch_comm_WA[["Year"]])`.
Data from the reconstruction was used instead of data in \gls{pacfin} when there was
overlap because
\gls{wdfw} separates landings from each fish ticket by area.
This is important for fish tickets that include landings from
Alaskan, Canadian, Puget Sound, and oceanic waters.
In \gls{pacfin}, it is more than likely that landings from different
areas included on a single fish ticket would be assigned to
just one area and partitioning out these landings to area would require
accessing logbook information as well as fish ticket information, which is
difficult and not part of the current \gls{pacfin} protocols.
The reconstruction should largely match what is in \gls{pacfin} because \gls{pacfin}
does not currently have landings for years prior to 1980 and
Canadian waters have been closed to U.S. fishers
targeting groundfish since 1978.

The reconstruction includes data from many sources, but consistently
recorded data were largely available starting in 1943 from
U.S. Fish Commission reports.
Landings from prior to 1941 were converted to round fish weight using a
conversion factor of 1.431 because it is assumed that reports were of filleted fish.
Linear interpretation between adjacent years was used to fill in years without
landings information. In the 2017 assessment, [@haltuch2019lingcod]
missing years were filled forward rather than linearly interpolated
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-state)).
These differences were minor, and there were no major changes in the time series
compared to what was used in the previous assessment.
```

```{asis, catch-comm-OR-reconstruction, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
##### Oregon commercial reconstruction

In Oregon, historical commercial landings from
`r min(catch_comm_OR[["Year"]])` to
`r max(catch_comm_OR[["Year"]])`
were provided by \gls{odfw} [@karnowski2014].
Historical landings began with exclusively longline landings,
which was the primary gear type
until the development of the trawl fishery in the 1940s.
Historical landings exhibited an increasing trend until peaking at
`r sprintf("%.0f mt in %.0f", catch_comm_OR_summary[["sum"]], catch_comm_OR_summary[["Year"]])`
and averaged `r sprintf("%.1f mt", catch_comm_OR_summary[["mean"]])` annually.
```

##### California commercial reconstruction

<!--@sette1928-->
@sette1928 provided information from interviews and state records
on fishing patterns from 1888 to 1926
for eight regions within U.S. waters.
States along the Pacific Coast comprised one region,
though state-specific landings were provided for Washington, Oregon,
and California by species or species groups.
For `r utils_name("common")`, the first positive record was from
`r catch_sette1928 %>% dplyr::filter(lbs > 0) %>% dplyr::pull(Year) %>% min`
and positive landings were documented for
`r length(catch_sette1928 %>% dplyr::filter(lbs > 0) %>% dplyr::pull(Year) %>% unique) - 1`
years.
We used linear interpolation to fill in years with missing data,
ramping up from zero in
`r min(catch_sette1928[["Year"]])`
to create a time series of
`r length(min(catch_sette1928[["Year"]]):max(catch_sette1928[["Year"]]))`
years (Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-CA-interpolate-ts)).

Catches by gear type were only available from 1926, and thus,
the calculated proportion of of the landings
caught by FG and TW in 1926 was applied to all years because it was
assumed that ratios were similar across the time series.
Proportionally, FG represented
`r catch_sette_prop_fa %>% dplyr::filter(fleet == "TW") %>% dplyr::pull(prop_fa) %>% sprintf("%.2f",.) %>% knitr::combine_words()`
of the total catch for the
`r catch_sette_prop_fa %>% dplyr::filter(fleet == "TW") %>% dplyr::pull(area) %>% tolower() %>% knitr::combine_words(.)`
areas, respectively.
The Northern California district was
assumed to represent north of 40 degrees ten minutes and
all other districts combined were used to represent the southern area.

Landings from
[California fish market data](https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/las_fish1/doc/names_describe.html),
available within the
[ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdCAMarCatLM.html)
database,
were used to estimate the proportion of early landings that occurred in
the northern area versus the southern area because fish market data were recorded
by region on a yearly basis [@mason2004] within this data set.
Whereas, @sette1928 only contained information on area for a single year.
California fish market data represent a multi-organizational effort,
but most landings are from
fish ticket information collected by \gls{cdfw}.
First, we calculated the yearly proportion of landings that occurred within
the Eureka region north of Point Arena compared to all other regions
`r sprintf("(%.2f)", erddapmeanpropEureka)`
from port-specific landings from
`r min(catch_erddap[["Year"]])`
to
`r sprintf("%s.", erddapmaxyrmeanbyarea)`
Second, the proportion of landings within Eureka region
that occurred north versus south of Cape Mendocino
`r sprintf("(%.2f)", erddapmeanpropNEureka)`
was calculated from 100-200 block data [@Miller_2014]
starting in 1925 to 1931.
The product of the means of these two proportions
was used to partition data from @sette1928 to area.

<!--California fish market landings-->
[California fish market data](https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/las_fish1/doc/names_describe.html),
were available from the
[ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/erdCAMarCatLM.html)
database
over many years, but only those years that were missing
between @sette1928 and the California Catch Reconstruction Project
[@NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-461] were used.
This resulted in keeping data from
`r paste0(paste(collapse = " to ", catch_erddap %>% dplyr::filter(Year < catch_comm_CA_ralston$Year %>% min) %>% dplyr::pull(Year) %>% range),".")`
<!--- to do: more text on erddap -->

Information on region of landing was available and
provided a means to assign the landings to the northern
and southern areas. Though as previously mentioned,
the Eureka region needed to be partitioned to area.
We used the mean proportion of fish landed in the northern Eureka
region `r sprintf("(%.2f)", erddapmeanpropNEureka)` from block data [@Miller_2014]
to partition the sum of yearly landings within
the Eureka region between areas.

<!--@NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-461-->
@NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-461 represents the effort led by the \gls{swfsc}
to reconstruct groundfish landings for the \gls{pfmc}, which
are seen as the best available data for historical commercial
landings from California ports.
The data includes information on region of landing based on block assignments.
Landings within region nine were assumed to be caught off of Mexico
and were removed.
Landings with a region code of two were partitioned to the northern and southern areas
using the same method used above for California fish market landings.
To check the validity of this assumption, we compared the proportion of
landings assigned to the north versus the south to
proportions calculated from confidential
fish ticket data available in \gls{calcom} that have information on port of landing
for available years between
`r paste(collapse = " - ", range(catch_comm_CA_MM[catch_comm_CA_MM[["type"]] == "ALL","Year"]))`
(pers. comm., M. Monk, \gls{swfsc}).
The proportions showed similar trends, though the former were consistently
higher than the latter for all years
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-CA-proportionnorth)).

The @NOAA-TM-NMFS-SWFSC-461 data also had to be partitioned to
fleet given it does not contain information about gear.
Fish ticket information in \gls{calcom} was used to calculate the
proportion of landings landed by each fleet for the northern
and southern areas separately; thus, partitioning landings by year
into four groups, northern TW, northern FG, southern TW,
and southern FG. Proportions were only available for
the following years:
`r knitr::combine_words(catch_comm_CA_MM[catch_comm_CA_MM[["type"]] == "ALL","Year"])`.
Years with no information were back filled using adjacent years.

<!--CALCOM landings-->
Starting in
`r sprintf("%.0f,", min(catch_comm_CA_calcom[["Year"]]))`
commercial landings were available for California by port-group complex
and gear group from \gls{calcom}.
The following gear groups
`r knitr::combine_words(unique(catch_comm_CA_calcom %>% dplyr::filter(!GEAR_GRP %in% calcom_fleet_TW) %>% dplyr::pull(GEAR_GRP)))`
were combined to encompass FG and
`r knitr::combine_words(calcom_fleet_TW)`
gear groups were combined to encompass TW.

Unfortunately, the port-group complexes did not exactly align with the
north-south split. But, it was assumed that the amount of landings
within the Eureka port-group complex that occurred in the south was
minor, and thus, all landings within the Crescent City
and Eureka port-group complexes were assigned to the northern area
and all other ports were assigned to the southern area.

<!--Washington and Oregon catches landed in California-->
```{asis, eval = params$model == "North", echo = TRUE}
Landings caught off of the coast of Oregon
`r sprintf("(%.2f mt)", sum(catch_comm_CA_ORwaters[["Oregon"]]))`
and Washington
`r sprintf("(%.2f mt)", sum(catch_comm_CA_ORwaters[["Washington"]]))`
but landed in California during the period
`r format_range(catch_comm_CA_ORwaters[["Year"]], parentheses = FALSE)`
were added to the California reconstruction as was done in the previous assessment.
These landings were assigned to the northern area TW fleet.
In the future, the assignment of species and gear should be investigated
more thoroughly for these landings.
```

<!-- Missing data -->
For combinations of year, area, and fleet that were missing
in the reconstruction of California commercial landings,
landings were interpolated based on a linear approximation
between adjacent years with data
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-CA-interpolate-ts)).
Thus, the reconstruction ramped up from zero starting in
`r catch_sette1928[["Year"]][1]`
to
`r sprintf("%.2f", catch_sette1928 %>% dplyr::filter(mt > 0) %>% dplyr::pull(mt) %>% dplyr::first())`
mt in
`r catch_sette1928 %>% dplyr::filter(mt > 0) %>% dplyr::pull(Year) %>% dplyr::first()`
and all subsequent missing years of data were filled in based on
linear interpolation between missing years
for a given area and fleet combination.

#### \glsentrylong{pacfin} (\glsentryshort{pacfin})

Commercial data were downloaded from the PacFIN database and provided
landings for Washington, Oregon, and California
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-ts-pacfin)).
These landings were treated as the best available information for
California since `r min(catch.pacfin[["Year"]])` and
for Washington and Oregon since the beginning of
`r sprintf("%s and %s,", 1 + max(catch_comm_WA[["Year"]]), 1 + max(catch_comm_OR[["Year"]]))`
respectively.

```{asis, catch-comm-OR-recent, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
Though `r utils_name("common")` are encountered in a wide variety of gear types in Oregon,
most landings are from bottom trawl gear types
`r sprintf("(%.1f percent from %.0f - %.0f).", catch_comm_pacfin_summary %>% dplyr::filter(state == "OR",fleet=="TW") %>% dplyr::pull(prop) %>% mean * 100, max(catch_comm_OR[["Year"]]) + 1, max(catch.pacfin[["Year"]]) - 1)`
Landings from all other gear types are minimal relative to TW and FG and relatively sporadic.
Commercial landings from Oregon waters between
`r sprintf("%.0f - %.0f", max(catch_comm_OR[["Year"]]), max(catch.pacfin[["Year"]]) - 1)`
peaked in
`r catch_comm_pacfin_summary %>% dplyr::filter(state == "OR") %>% dplyr::pull(maxYear) %>% dplyr::first()`
at
`r catch_comm_pacfin_summary %>% dplyr::filter(state == "OR") %>% dplyr::pull(max) %>% dplyr::first() %>% sprintf("%.2f", .)`
before declining and fluctuating between
`r catch_comm_pacfin_summary %>% dplyr::filter(state == "OR" & Year >= 2000) %>% dplyr::pull(yearsum) %>% range %>% sprintf("%.2f",.) %>% knitr::combine_words()`
mt since 2000.
```

Before splitting the commercial landings to area, all landings that
were known to have been caught outside of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone
`r sprintf("(%.2f mt)", removenonEEZcatch)`
were removed.
These were landings that occurred in
an unknown \gls{inpfc} area noted as XX or \gls{pacfin} area 02 or 4A.

The split at \CapeM required finding a method for
splitting data within the Eureka (ERA) port-group complex.
Data with the port of landing of Shelter Cove, a port within ERA, were
assigned to the southern model and data from all other ports within ERA, i.e.,
`r paste0(knitr::combine_words(catch_comm_CA_ERA), ",")`
were assigned to the northern model.
If landings were not assigned to a port-group complex, then the physical location
of the port of landing was used to assign an area. Lastly, if both
port-group complex and port of landing were unknown, then the landings were
assigned to an area based on a vessel's historical behavior while landing `r spp`.
This ad hoc method that was used to assign area of landing to a trivial amount
of landings without spatial information
(`r sprintf("(%.2f mt)", sum(catch_comm_CA_noport[["sumMT"]]))`)
has almost zero influence on the resulting catch streams and was done largely as
an exercise to document how to do this should the stock boundary change again and the
numbers would need to be recalculated.
For example, if more than half of a vessel's landings of
`r utils_name("common")`
were in ERA or CCA, then all of their landings without an assigned
area were assigned to the northern area.

### Recreational landings

#### Recreational fleet structure

Recreational data were first compiled to the state level as a single fleet
with all gear types. Then, data from northern California was added to the northern
model as its own fleet rather than being combined with Oregon recreational data
because each fishery is subject to unique regulations that affect selectivity
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-rec-ts)).
The remaining data from California was used to model recreational fisheries
in the southern area as a single fleet.

```{asis, catch-rec-WA-text, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
#### Washington recreational landings

The time series of recreational catches (numbers of fish)
were provided by \gls{wdfw} and
included information on fishing within Washington's coastal areas sampled by the
Ocean Sampling Program in Marine Areas 1-4.
Catches that were landed within the Strait of Juan de Fuca, i.e.,
Bonilla-Tatoosh line to the mouth of the Sekiu River,
and sampled by the Puget Sound Sampling Program were included in the landings
because they were potentially caught in ocean waters even though they were
landed in coastal waters. All other landings from the Puget Sound Sampling Program
were excluded because they are from the Puget Sound rather than the Pacific Ocean.

First, we calculated the mean length
`r sprintf("(%0.2f mm)", bio_rec_recfin_meanlength %>% dplyr::filter(STATE_NAME == "WASHINGTON") %>% dplyr::pull(mean_length))`
of fish landed within Washington recreational fishery
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-rec-tsrecfinmeanlength)) across all years
`r format_range(bio_rec_recfin %>% dplyr::filter(STATE_NAME == "WASHINGTON") %>% dplyr::pull(Year))`
and sexes.
Next, we used this mean length and the weight-length relationship
as calculated from the most recent survey data to determine the mean weight.
Finally, weight (mt) was determined from mean weight and numbers.
Final landings include retained and 7\% of discarded fish to account for those that died.
The previous assessment modeled Washington landings in terms of numbers of fish rather than weight
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-rec-ca-oldts)).
```

```{asis, catch-rec-OR-text, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
#### Oregon recreational landings

The recreational fishery in Oregon likely began in the early 1950s or 1960s
but data on catches prior to
`r min(data_catch %>% dplyr::filter(fleet == "OR") %>% dplyr::pull("Year"))`
are not available.
ODFW provided the time series of catches that includes information on
shoreside activities, estuary boats, private ocean boats, and charter ocean boats.

<!-- Historical ocean boat landings (1974 – 2000) -->
Recently, \gls{odfw} undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct
all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001
(pers. comm., A. Whitman, \gls{odfw}).
Reconstructed catch estimates from \gls{orbs} improve upon estimates
from the federal \gls{mrfss},
which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling
[@vanvoorhees2000]
that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by \gls{odfw}.
However, the \gls{orbs} sample estimates are known to lack the
comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of \gls{mrfss}.
Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction.
In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed
estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species
[@dick2016china; @dick2018bluedeacon; @haltuch2019lingcod; @cope2019cabezon].

Prior to 2001, \gls{orbs} monitored marine species in
both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and
other miscellaneous fishes, and
as individual species, such as lingcod or halibut.
For this comprehensive reconstruction,
four species categories were selected to reconstruct,
including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish, and miscellaneous,
which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species.
Lingcod have been a single species category throughout this time period.

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage
in two separate pathways.
First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled
winter months in years lacking complete coverage.
Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and
excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch.
Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include
seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on
the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates.
A subset of landings were sampled by \gls{orbs}
for species compositions within these categories.
Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time,
species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories,
including rockfish, flatfish, and miscellaneous fish.
Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and
determined based on a series of regression tree analyses
that detailed the importance of each domain
(year, month, port, and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.

Ocean boat estimates from 1979 – 2000 in numbers of fish of
`r utils_name("common")` from the above described methods were
converted to biomass using biological samples from \gls{mrfss}
(pers. comm., A. Whitman, \gls{odfw}).
\Gls{mrfss} biological data are available from
1980 – 1989 and 1993 – 2000.
An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish
to obtain an annual landings estimate.
Several years missing biological data (1979, 1990 – 1992)
were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation.
Landings from 1974 – 1978 were estimated using similar
methods to the above reconstruction,
but are not currently part of this reconstructed time period,
and were not updated from the 2017 assessment [@haltuch2019lingcod].
Updated landings include only those from 1979 – 2000.
These landings in biomass were provided by \gls{odfw}
and do not include an estimate of discards.
Landings during this time period fluctuate,
with a peak of 237.2 mt in 1993,
and fluctuate between approximately 50 and 200 mt
following that peak (1979 – 2000).

<!-- Modern ocean boat landings (2001 – 2020) -->
Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001 – 2020
are available from \gls{recfin} (extracted on 03/19/2021).
Both retained and released estimates of mortality are included,
though retained mortality contributes the vast majority to total mortality.
Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and
the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC.
From 2001 – 2020, landings averaged 139.4 mt,
ranging from 60.1 mt in 2001 to 229.1 mt in 2015.
In 2020, Oregon ocean boat landings were 172.5 mt.

<!-- Shore and estuary landings (1980 – 2020) -->
\Gls{odfw} provided reconstructed estimates of shore and estuary
landings for `r spp` from 1980 – 2020,
using methodology similar to recent assessments
[@berger2015kelpgreenling; @dick2018bluedeacon; @cope2019cabezon].
Data sources include \gls{mrfss} and \gls{sebs}.
Numbers of fish were provided by \gls{mrfss}
from 1980 – 1989 and 1993 – June 2003, and
by \gls{sebs} from July 2003 – June 2005.
An annual mode-specific average weight was applied to numbers of
`r utils_name("common")` from 1980 – 1989 and 1993 – 2005.
Separate weights were calculated for shore and estuary boat modes and
excluded extreme outliers and imputed values.
This reconstruction also applied two scaling factors to
remove bias towards freshwater sampling and
underestimation of estuary boats [@dick2018bluedeacon].
To estimate `r utils_name("common")` landings from July – December 2005,
an expansion was developed using the three year average of the ratio between
the first six months of the year and the total annual landings from
\gls{mrfss} and \gls{sebs} landings from 2002 - 2004.
Separate expansions were developed for shore mode and estuary boat modes.

The \gls{odfw} does not currently sample shore and estuary boat fishing trips,
so a 10 year average landing (1996 – 2005; 6.7 mt/year)
was used to estimate shore and estuary boat landings during 2006 – 2020.
Shore and estuary boat landings combined fluctuate but gradually increase
until peaking in 1993 at 16.7 mt.
Shore and estuary boat landings average 6.5 mt annually from 1980 – 2003.
Shore and estuary landings were combined with the ocean boat landings
for the total Oregon recreational landings (1974 – 2020).
```

#### California recreational landings

<!-- \glsentrylong{mrfss} (\glsentryshort{mrfss}) -->
California recreational `r utils_name("common")` catches since
`r min(catch_rec_1980[["Year"]]) - 1`
are available within the \gls{mrfss} database
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-rec-CA-ts)) and stored in
the \gls{recfin} database.
The first year of data are typically not used because of the lack
of standardization within the sampling protocols which led to vastly
different estimates of catches compared to later years. Thus,
`r min(catch_rec_1980[["Year"]])`
is used as the first year of \gls{mrfss} data.
Data were provided by John Field for years prior to
`r min(catch_rec_1980[["Year"]])`
and these data have been unchanged since the
2009 assessment of `r utils_name("common")` [@hamel2009lingcod].

For this assessment, we had to split the historical data provided by
John Field and \gls{mrfss} to area. This was accomplished using data from
Albin et al. (1993) that includes county-specific estimates of landings.
Area-specific landings were informative about the proportion
of landings in Del Norte and Humboldt county
relative to the rest of the California coast.
A catch-weighted mean proportion for the years
`r knitr::combine_words(unique(data_albin$Year))`
was used to split coast-wide recreational landings to area.

Between 1990 and 1992, the \gls{mrfss} sampling program ceased
because of budgetary limitations.
Additionally, there was a transition year between \gls{mrfss}
and \gls{crfs} without data.
Thus, linear interpolation was used to provide proxy estimates for
`r knitr::combine_words(catch_rec_CA %>% dplyr::filter(source == "interpolate") %>% dplyr::pull(Year) %>% unique)`
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-rec-CA-ts)).

<!-- \glsentrylong{crfs} (\glsentryshort{crfs}) -->
Sampling under \gls{crfs} started in January of
`r catch_rec_2000$Year %>% min`
and data are still currently being collected.
Information includes data on port group
that was used to partition landings to area.
Redwood was assigned to the northern area for all years since 2005,
even though Redwood in 2005 through 2007 also contained landings from
Shelter Cove.
This time series also includes landings from Mexico and Canada
that were excluded from this analysis.

### Comparison of current catch stream to previous model

The current time series of catches were aggregated using the previous
model structure, i.e., the northern area included Washington and Oregon and the
southern area included California, for comparison purposes
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-state)).
This comparison revealed differences in the current catch stream for the commercial
FG and TW fleets compared to what was previously used for the southern model.
It was determined that the 2017 catch stream for the California TW fleet included
catches from both TW and FG fleets. This has since been corrected, and the current catch
stream represents what is known to be the best available data.

```{asis, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
Differences in the reconstructions for commercial catches are the result
of linearly interpolating historical data rather than assuming it was equal to
the previous year (Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-state)).
```
Differences in the early reconstruction for California commercial catches are the result
of using landings from @sette1928 instead of ramping up catches from zero
(Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-state)).
