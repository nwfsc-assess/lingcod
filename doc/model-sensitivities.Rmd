The sensitivity analyses were divided into three groups: biology and recruitment,
composition, indices, and selectivity
`r sprintf("(Tables \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s); Figures \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s))", 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-bio-rec"), 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-sel"), 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-bio-rec"),
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-sel")
)`.

The biology and recruitment sensitivities included

- fix female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7
- fix female $M$ at 0.3
- fix $h$ at 0.7
- estimate a single $M$ for both sexes with a prior which is a mixture distribution 
of the two priors sex-specific priors in the base model 
(a lognormal with mean = 0.358, sd = 0.467)
- decrease $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.4
- increase $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.8

The composition sensitivities included

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- add all additional ages as CAAL to the south model
- add all additional ages as marginal
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- remove all fishery-dependent age data from the north model
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```

Additional composition-related sensitivities were conducted in earlier versions of
the model but were not repeated for the final base model.

The index sensitivities involved removing each index from the model as well
as removing all the fishery-dependent indices together.
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
Also included in the index sensitivities was changing the index associated with the
Oregon recreational fishery from one based on the ORBS sampling program to 
an alternative index developed from onboard CPFV observations.

```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
Also included in the index sensitivities was changing the index associated with the 
California recreational fishery in recent years from one based on the onboard CPFV 
observations to an alternative index developed from the CRFS sampling of private 
and rental boats.
```

The selectivity sensitivities included
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- make the fixed-gear fishery selectivity asymptotic rather than dome shaped
(in the north model it is estimated as asymptotic)
```
- allow sex-specific selectivity by adding for each fleet representing 
the difference between females and males in the height of the peak 
selectivity
- allow sex-specific selectivity as above while also fixing female $M$ = 0.3
- make retention in the early period equal to the recent period
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- make the scale and descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific 
for all fisheries selectivity but retain shared selectivity for females and males
in the surveys

Numerous additional sensitivities related to sex-specific selectivity
were conducted for the north model during the STAR review, 
none of which provided model results which were more plausible
than the chosen base model. See the STAR report for more detail on these
additional sensitivities.

TO DO: UPDATE TEXT BELOW ON RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from 
get_mod('n', 22) # base

compare <- r4ss::SSsummarize(list(mod.2021.n.022.001, mod.2021.n.022.103))
apply(compare$Bratio[1:2], 2, min) %>% round(2)
round(compare$Bratio[compare$Bratio$Yr == 2021,1:2], 2)
-->
The north model was sensitive to the to the sensitivity of fixing female $M$ at 0.
3 and $h$ at 0.7. This pushed the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass down
slightly, but the lower productivity associated with these parameters mean that the
catch history drove the stock down to a minimum fraction unfished of 18\%
compared to 31\% in the base model. The fraction unfished at the start of 2021 
in that sensitivity is 32\% compared to 63\% for the base model. 
The negative log-likelihood for this sensitivity is 14 units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits to all data sources with the exception of the age comps
which have an improvement in fit of 11 units.

Among the composition sensitivities, the north model was sensitive to removing the
fishery-dependent ages, which reduced the estimate of female $M$ from 0.41 to 0.33 
and pushed the scale upwards. Applying the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood 
for the composition data (which led to higher weights for these data) 
had the opposite effect, bringing the scale downwards.

The sensitivities related to removing indices from the north model had relatively little
impact with the exception of the one in which all fishery CPUE indices
were removed, which increased the scale from 62\% of $B_0$% in 2021 to 82\%.

```

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from 
get_mod('s', 14) # base
get_mod('s', 14, 103) # sensitity
compare <- r4ss::SSsummarize(list(mod.2021.s.014.001, mod.2021.s.014.103))
apply(compare$Bratio[1:2], 2, min) %>% round(2)
round(compare$Bratio[compare$Bratio$Yr == 2021,1:2], 2)
-->
Among the biology and recruitment sensitivities, the south model was most sensitive to
fixing female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7 which increased the productivity of the 
stock enough to result in a 2021 spawning biomass estimate at 97\% of $B_0$.
The negative log-likelihood for this sensitivity is 6.7 units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits the index and length comp data and better fits to the age
compositions which have an improvement in fit of 3.6 units.

The addition of ages as CAAL or marginal in the south model likewise pushed the 
scale upwards (with the scale of the biomass in the CAAL sensitivity so high that
it doesn't appear within the range shown in the figure). The Dirichlet-Multinomial
sensitivity, which led to increased weight on the length and age compositions
likewise pushed the scale upwards.

The two sensitivities related to removing indices which had the most impact were
those related to the historical indices: the \gls{s-tri} and 
the recreational CPFV Deb Wilson-Vandenberg index. 
Without the recreational index, the stock was estimated to have had a very large
recruitment in 1952, driving the stock high above $B_0$ in the 1950s and 1960s.
Removing the \gls{s-tri} caused the stock to continue to decline in the 1990s and 
early 2000s instead of stabilizing and then increasing to better fit the higher
2004 \gls{s-tri} observation.
