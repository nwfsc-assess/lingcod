#### PacFIN trawl logbook index

A commercial trawl \gls{cpue} index was retained from the previous assessment
[@haltuch2019lingcod].
The index spans the years 1981-1997,
ending before the 1998 changes in management
(Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets)).
As in the last assessment,
the coastwide estimates were post-stratified to produce a time series for each area.
The stratification was updated to reflect the new boundary at \CapeM
(pers. comm., J. Wallace, \gls{nwfsc}).
The choice to not re-estimate the fits to the data and just update the stratification was driven by
the intense computational needs to refit the model and
the similarity of the results of the fishery-independent \gls{cpue} regardless of how they were modeled.
