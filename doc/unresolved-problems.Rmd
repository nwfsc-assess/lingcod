The base-model configuration was developed with the goal of balancing parsimony with realism and fitting the data.
To achieve parsimony, some simplification of the model structure was assumed relative to known processes,
which may impact the interpretation and fit to specific data sets.
For example, a clear break between the northern and southern stock at Cape Mendocino is unrealistic but
we do not currently have the resources necessary to add spatial dynamics to the stock assessment or
estimate the level of overlap between the stocks.

Patterns of sex-specific selectivity were apparent in the data, 
particularly for the fishing fleets. Unfortunately, we were unable to configure 
the model in such a way that the model fit all data sources equally as well
as the base-model configuration when attempting to account for these patterns.
Numerous attempts at sex-specific selectivity were explored shortly before and during 
the stock assessment review. However, overparameterization was a problem. 
There are more than 50 selectivity parameters in the base model (with selectivity
equal for females and males), so adding sex-specific offsets or separate parameters 
for caused estimation problems and implausible selectivity patterns. Options
explored included sex-specific offset for the height of the peak selectivity
as well as offsets for the position of the peak and the descending slopes. Therefore,
new research to develop an theoretical basis for sex-specific differences
in selectivity or availability using differences in spatial distribution or behavior
may be a more fruitful path for future selectivity setups than relying simply on 
fits to data and other model diagnostics.

Uncertainty in parameter estimates are quite large relative to recent assessments because of the choice to estimate
both natural mortality and steepness.
Recent work has shown the utility of estimating both parameters with respect to 
management reference points, and although estimates provided in this document are imprecise,
we predict that they are less biased than if the model would have been configured 
with one or more of these parameters as fixed inputs rather than estimated.
Estimating both parameters led to counter-intuitive differences in estimates of 
natural mortality between the southern and northern areas.
Hopefully, future work on parameterizing selectivity will lead to more precise 
estimates of male and female natural mortality given the life history of this 
species, specifically the nest-guarding behavior of males.
