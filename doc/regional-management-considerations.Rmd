Separate commercial quotas for `r spp` are set for the areas north and south 
of \CapeM which aligns with the division between areas used in these 
assessments.
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
Management of recreational fisheries is conducted at the 
state level, which aligns with the fleet structure used in this model,
where the catch associated with the recreational California fishery
in any projection would be combined with the recreational catch in the 
south model.

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
Management of recreational fisheries is conducted at the 
state level, which aligns with the fleet structure used in this model,
where the catch associated with the recreational California fishery
in any projection would be combined with the recreational California catch 
in the north model.

The average proportions of the total dead catch, including estimated dead 
discards, associated with each fleet over the period 2011-2020 are:
`r prop_text`.

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
However, for purposes of the projections, the split between commercial 
trawl and fixed-gear in the south was assumed to be 40:60, 
based on input from the GMT, leading to the following proportions among fleets:
`r prop_text2`.

Estimation of finer-scale differences in Lingcod abundance or status within 
California, such as north and south of Point Conception (\PtC), was not possible
within this assessment. However, the state of California could apply finer-scale
spatial management to account for any regional management considerations indicated
by other sources of information about the `r spp` in those waters.
