`r Spp` fisheries have a long history
(Table \@ref(tab:table-catchbystate)).
The earliest evidence of fishing for `r spp`
comes from the remains of 51 archaeological sites
representing the period between 6200 BC and 1830 AD on the
central California coast from San Mateo to San Luis Obispo [@gobalet1995prehistoric].
The commercial fishery off
California dates back more than a century to at least the 1890s and
the fisheries off of Washington and Oregon date back nearly as far (i.e., 1940s).
These commercial fishers are largely harvesting using trawl and longline gear.
For longline and other fixed gear in waters off of California, the majority
of the landings from these gear types have consistently been landed
off of the southern rather than the northern portion of the coast
(upper panel of Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-CA-gearprop)).
Comparatively, the trawl fishery off of the California coast has progressively
shifted north with time (lower panel of Figure \@ref(fig:catch-comm-CA-gearprop)).
Recreational fisheries are dominated by hook-and-line and spear methods.

The commercial fishery steadily grew with the rise of the groundfish trawl industry.
Commercial landings peaked in the early 1980s and were followed by decreasing landings
because of management measures implemented due to population declines.
Management largely relied on seasonal closures and size limits to limit landings.
Coastwide, the `r spp` fishery was declared overfished in 1999.
With the combination of
a federal rebuilding plan implemented during 2003 and
years of good recruitment,
the population was deemed recovered in 2005,
four years ahead of the projected recovery time.

In California, the recreational `r spp` fishery has had substantial landings
that have surpassed that of the commercial fleet operating in California waters
since 1998
(Table \@ref(tab:table-catchbystate)).
At the peak of the `r spp` fishery, in `r textCatchpeakyear`,
the landings were nearly equally divided between the commercial and recreational fleets.
From 1980 to 2008, 95\% to 97\% of `r spp` caught were taken by boat-based anglers via
\glspl{cpfv} and private/rental boats.
Private boat landings were higher than those from \glspl{cpfv}.
A small fraction of landings are from spear fishers using SCUBA or free diving gear [@lynn2008status].

Catches of `r spp` in Oregon and Washington have shifted from the commercial trawl fleet,
which accounted for 90\% of landings during its mid-1980s peak,
to a fishery evenly split between commercial and recreational landings in recent years.
Between 1980 and 1996, the majority of `r spp` were caught by the bottom trawl fishery (>75\%),
followed by troll and hook-and-line (between 10-20\%),
with a small fraction of additional landings from
pots and traps, nets, and shrimp trawls [@jagielo1997assessment].
Since 1999, however, the recreational fishery has contributed about half
of all `r spp` Oregon and Washington landings, on average, and has continued to grow.
