Investigating and or addressing the following items could improve future assessments of `r spp`: 

- Explore fine-scale spatial distribution of `r spp` of different ages and sexes relative to
the distribution of fishing effort and survey sampling locations to inform modeling
assumptions related to dome-shaped and sex-specific selectivity.
- Explore ways to model sex-specific selectivity that provide additional flexibility
in the models to account for such patterns without overparameterizing the model
or creating implausibly different estimates of selectivity and natural mortality.
- Provide comparisons of model results with `r spp` density or trends in abundance
estimated from sources such as video landers and ROVs.
- Continue to explore age-dependent natural mortality either through the Lorenzen
function or other approaches.
- Improve data-weighting approaches to facilitate separate tuning of 
sample sizes for discard and retained fish from the same fleet and appropriately
weight data on discard rates and mean body weight. These changes will hopefully 
bring the estimates of total mortality for years with high discard rates closer to
the values reported by the WCGOP program's GEMM report.
- Improve understanding of the source of conflict between age and length data for lingcod
- Explore the costs and benefits of including both length- and age-composition data 
for multiple fleets in general for data-rich (but possibly information-poor) species
like `r spp`.
