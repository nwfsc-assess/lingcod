The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning biomass was 
$\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty around the \gls{ofl}
was $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma, 2)`. 
```{asis, opts.label = "north"}
This is likely an underestimate of overall uncertainty because there is no 
explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the 
decision table for alternative states of nature).
```
```{asis, opts.label = "south"}
This is likely an underestimate of overall uncertainty because there is no 
explicit incorporation of structural uncertainty related to the model.
```
The category 2 default $\sigma$ = 1.0 is used to apply scientific uncertainty
in the projections.
