#### Oregon recreational index

Trip-level \gls{cpue} data from \gls{orbs} dockside sampling program was
analyzed by \gls{odfw} and included in the assessment as a
relative index of abundance for the Oregon recreational fleet.
The dataset represents the longest time series available for this fleet and
contains information on
catch by species (number of retained fish),
effort (angler hours),
sample location (port where data were collected),
date,
bag limits,
boat type (charter or private), and
trip type (e.g., bottom-associated fish).
\Gls{cpue},
expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour.
Angler-hour is the number of anglers multiplied by
the number of hours fished minus by travel time.
Travel time is twice the distance between the port of origin and the fished reef
multiplied by 13 mph for charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips.

The unfiltered data set contained 411,528 trips.
Multiple filters were applied to the trip-level data
to increase the number of positive trips for `r spp`
(Table \@ref(tab:cpue-recreationalOregon-filter)).
These filters removed
trips from several ports with extremely small sample sizes;
trips that met criteria for implausible effort values or extreme catch rates;
trips with incorrect interview times, which impact calculation of effort;
unreasonably long or short trips;
catches exceeding bag limits, which would impact catch rates;
private vessel trips; and
trips that did not target bottom fish.
Filters were also utilized to account for temporal or spatial
closures impacting fishing.
Stephens-MacCall filtering was also investigated to identify
trips that were likely to catch `r spp` 
given the occurrence of other species in the catch
[@stephens2004].
Stephens-MacCall filtering did not change the diagnostics of the
resulting model, and thus,
it was not utilized to filter the data.

A Bayesian delta-\gls{glm} was used to model \gls{cpue}
[@rstanarm2020].
Investigated covariates included
month,
mega-region (north and south coasts divided at the port of Florence on the central Oregon coast),
port,
season (summer and winter),
`r spp` bag limit, and
depths available to the recreational fleet for fishing
(Figure \@ref(fig:reccpueor-orbsdatasummary)).
Season and mega-region were collinear
with month and port, respectively, and not investigated further.

The binomial model component for positive catches was modeled using a logit link function.
Based on \gls{aic} and \gls{bic}, the best binomial model
included year, port, month, and depths available to fishing.
Models with interactions between year and port or month did not converge due to missing trips in some strata.
A quantile-quantile plot of the simulated residuals [@hartig2021]
suggests that the binomial component of the delta-model is a
reasonable approximation of the data
(Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-recreationalOregonqqbin)).
Diagnostics were
substantially improved by excluding interactions between
year and open depths and the
removal of private boat trips.

The rate component for log of positive \gls{cpue} was modeled with a Gaussian distribution and an
identity link function.
The positive model
included year,
port, month and open depths available to fishing.
There were issues in
the DHARMa simulated residuals, including curvature and significant outliers
(Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-recreationalOregonqqpos)).
However, these diagnostics were improved by exclusion of
any interaction terms and the removal of the private vessel trips. There was
insufficient time to fully resolve these diagnostic issues and alternative
approaches may need to be explored for future assessments.
For example, an
area-weighted model was not utilized for `r spp`, as has been used for other
nearshore species in recent assessments, such as cabezon [@cope2019cabezon]
or blue rockfish [@dick2018bluedeacon].

The final index (Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets))
matched major trends in other \gls{cpue} fits with an
increase in 2010 and a current decrease in abundance.
