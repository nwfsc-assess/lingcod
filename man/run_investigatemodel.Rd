\title{Run all model investigations for a base model}
\usage{
run_investigatemodel(
  basemodelname,
  pars = system.file("extdata", "diagpars.csv", package = "lingcod"),
  run = c("jitter", "profile", "retro"),
  njitter = 100,
  extras = "-nohess -cbs 1500000000"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{basemodelname}{The name of the base model of interest in \code{modeldir}.
This can be a vector of names if you want to do the same thing for each
area.}

\item{pars}{A file path the csv with the parameter specifications.
The file has a column for area, with values matching what you use in your
model name for area, e.g., 2009.n.001.001_test, would be a northern model.
and the remaining columns are parameter inputs for
\link[nwfscDiag:get_settings_profile]{nwfscDiag::get_settings_profile}, and the column names must match the
formals exactly because they are used with \link{do.call}.
You can pass any file you want, but the default is to use the one saved internal
to this package.}

\item{run}{A vector of options you want to run,
where the default is to run them all.}

\item{njitter}{An integer number of jitter runs you want to complete.}

\item{extras}{A single character entry that will be passed to \link{system}
when running SS. Typically this is \code{"-nohess"} but we have added cbs to make it
"-nohess -cbs 1500000000" which will decrease run time for larger models.

\details{
notes:
\itemize{
\item The whole process will fail if a single model doesn't converge in the retro.
\item The process will in retro if no forecasts.
\item Error from SS_doretro I think has file names pasted together without spaces.
\verb{Error in r4ss::SS_doRetro(masterdir = retro_dir, overwrite = model_settings$overwrite,  :}
\verb{error copying file(s): ss.exeforecast.ssling_control.ssling_data.ss}
}
