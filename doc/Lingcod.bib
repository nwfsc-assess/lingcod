    abstract = "Fishery management decisions are commonly guided by stock assessment models that aggregate outputs across the spatial domain of the species. With refined understanding of spatial population structures, scientists have begun to address how spatiotemporal mismatches among the scale of ecological processes, data collection programs, and stock assessment methods (or assumptions) influence the reliability and, ultimately, appropriateness of regional fishery management (e.g., assigning regional quotas). Development and evaluation of spatial modeling techniques to improve fisheries assessment and management have increased rapidly in recent years. We overview the historical context of spatial models in fisheries science, highlight recent advances in spatial modeling, and discuss how spatial models have been incorporated into the management process. Despite limited examples where spatial assessment models are used as the basis for management advice, continued investment in fine-scale data collection and associated spatial analyses will improve integration of spatial dynamics and ecosystem-level interactions in stock assessment. In the near future, spatiotemporal fisheries management advice will increasingly rely on fine-scale outputs from spatial analyses."

However, management boundaries tend to be static and determined by politically negotiated or historically identified population (or multi-species) units, which create a potential disconnect with underlying, dynamic population structure. The consequences of incoherent management and population or stock boundaries were explored through the application of a two-area spatial simulation–estimation framework. Results highlight the importance of aligning management assessment areas with underlying population structure and processes, especially when fishing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogeneous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments (PSs) compared to assessments that cover a subset of a PS, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between PSs. Directed studies and due consideration of critical PSs, spatially explicit models, and dynamic management options that help align management and population boundaries would likely reduce estimation biases and management risk, as would closely coordinated management that functions across population boundaries.",

The {Center for the Advancement of Population Assessment Methodology} ({CAPAM}) hosted a workshop on {'Spatial Stock Assessment Models'} ({La Jolla, CA, USA}; {October} 1-5, 2018), and this special volume includes twelve papers on various aspects of spatial stock assessments, including stock identification, development and application of spatially-structured models, simulation studies, and management implications. The workshop and these contributions demonstrate that stock assessments require adequate representation of spatial scope and structure, and tag-integrated models generally perform best, but spatially-structured stock assessments pose several challenges, and remain rarely applied as the scientific basis for fishery management."

abstract = "Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization)."
