The sensitivity analyses were divided into three groups: biology and recruitment,
composition, and indices
`r sprintf("(Tables \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s); Figures \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s))", string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-bio-rec"), string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-comp"), string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-bio-rec"),string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-index")
)`.

The biology and recruitment sensitivities included

- estimate a single $M$ for both sexes with a prior which is a mixture distribution 
of the two priors sex-specific priors in the base model 
(a lognormal with mean = 0.358, sd = 0.467)
- fix $h$ at 0.7
- fix female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7
- increase $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.8
- decrease $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.4

The composition sensitivities included

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- add all additional ages as CAAL to the south model
- add all additional ages as marginal
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- remove all fishery-dependent age data from the north model
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```

Additional composition-related sensitivities were conducted in earlier versions of
the model but could not be repeated for the base model in time for inclusion in
this pre-review version of the report.

The index sensitivities involved removing each index from the model as well
as removing all the fishery-dependent indices.

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from 
get_mod('n', 22) # base
get_mod('n', 22, 103) # sensitivity
compare <- r4ss::SSsummarize(list(mod.2021.n.022.001, mod.2021.n.022.103))
apply(compare$Bratio[1:2], 2, min) %>% round(2)
round(compare$Bratio[compare$Bratio$Yr == 2021,1:2], 2)
-->
The north model was sensitive to the to the sensitivity of fixing female $M$ at 0.
3 and $h$ at 0.7. This pushed the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass down
slightly, but the lower productivity associated with these parameters mean that the
catch history drove the stock down to a minimum fraction unfished of 18\%
compared to 31\% in the base model. The fraction unfished at the start of 2021 
in that sensitivity is 32\% compared to 63\% for the base model. 
The negative log-likelihood for this sensitivity is 14 units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits to all data sources with the exception of the age comps
which have an improvement in fit of 11 units.

Among the composition sensitivities, the north model was sensitive to removing the
fishery-dependent ages, which reduced the estimate of female $M$ from 0.41 to 0.33 
and pushed the scale upwards. Applying the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood 
for the composition data (which led to higher weights for these data) 
had the opposite effect, bringing the scale downwards.

The sensitivities related to removing indices from the north model had relatively little
impact with the exception of the one in which all fishery CPUE indices
were removed, which increased the scale from 62\% of $B_0$% in 2021 to 82\%.

```

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from 
get_mod('s', 14) # base
get_mod('s', 14, 103) # sensitity
compare <- r4ss::SSsummarize(list(mod.2021.s.014.001, mod.2021.s.014.103))
apply(compare$Bratio[1:2], 2, min) %>% round(2)
round(compare$Bratio[compare$Bratio$Yr == 2021,1:2], 2)
-->
Among the biology and recruitment sensitivities, the south model was most sensitive to
fixing female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7 which increased the productivity of the 
stock enough to result in a 2021 spawning biomass estimate at 97\% of $B_0$.
The negative log-likelihood for this sensitivity is 6.7 units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits the index and length comp data and better fits to the age
compositions which have an improvement in fit of 3.6 units.

The addition of ages as CAAL or marginal in the south model likewise pushed the 
scale upwards (with the scale of the biomass in the CAAL sensitivity so high that
it doesn't appear within the range shown in the figure). The Dirichlet-Multinomial
sensitivity, which led to increased weight on the length and age compositions
likewise pushed the scale upwards.

The two sensitivities related to removing indices which had the most impact were
those related to the historical indices: the \gls{s-tri} and 
the recreational CPFV Deb Wilson-Vandenberg index. 
Without the recreational index, the stock was estimated to have had a very large
recruitment in 1952, driving the stock high above $B_0$ in the 1950s and 1960s.
Removing the \gls{s-tri} caused the stock to continue to decline in the 1990s and 
early 2000s instead of stabilizing and then increasing to better fit the higher
2004 \gls{s-tri} observation.
