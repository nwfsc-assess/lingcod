With the exceptions noted above, the general model specifications were 
retained from the previous assessment. The assessment is sex-specific, 
including the estimation of separate growth curves and natural mortality
for males and females. The sex ratio at birth is assumed to be 50:50.
Female spawning biomass is used in calculating stock status.

The model starts at equilibrium, assuming an unfished initial age structure
in 1889. The internal population dynamics include ages 0-25, where age 25 
is the plus-group. As there is little growth occurring at age 25 and 
very few observations, the data use a plus group of age 20.
<!-- OSH noted that the above statement is surprising given the max age of 13 and 18 -->

The following likelihood components are included in this model: catch, indices, 
discards, length compositions, age compositions, recruitments, parameter priors, 
and parameter soft bounds
(Table \ref{tab:table-likelihoods-base}).
See the Stock Synthesis technical documentation 
for details [@methot_stock_2013]. 
Estimated likelihood components from the base models 
can be found in the model output files archived with this report.
