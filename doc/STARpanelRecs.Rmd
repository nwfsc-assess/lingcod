<!-- Most recent STAR panel and SSC recommendations -->
<!-- cite star report -->
The 2017 STAR report noted four Unresolved Problems, 
three Major Uncertainties, and provided three specific recommendations for future 
research from the most recent full stock assessment on `r spp` [@haltuch2019lingcod]. 
In addition, the Panel made four recommendations for stock assessments in general. 

The three **specific recommendations** from the 2017 STAR panel were as follows:

1. There should be a study to cross-validate age-readings of lingcod 
  among the different laboratories contributing age data to the assessment. 
  It may be necessary to develop laboratory-specific (and possibly year-specific) 
  ageing-error vectors.
  
2. Available information on lingcod catches, abundance trends, and 
  age-compositions should be acquired from Canadian and Mexican authorities 
  to take an initial step towards a more spatially-comprehensive view of lingcod 
  population trends and dynamics.
  
3. The next iteration of this assessment could be an update assessment. 
  If a full assessment is done it should explore developing a spatial model 
  that encompasses the northern and southern areas rather than again treating 
  them as independent stocks, as in the current and previous assessments.
  
Two of the three recommendations were addressed.

Additional ageing comparisons were conducted and the ageing uncertainty was
re-estimated as described in the 
[Ageing Error](ageing-precision-and-bias) section of this report. 
However the new estimates showed similar uncertaity in ageing 
to the previous assessment. The differences among age distributions within
the same length bins among sources available for the southern model are
large enough that they are unlikely due to ageing uncertainty alone. 
Removing all ages other than those from the \gls{s-wcgbt} from the south 
model resolved this issue.

Additional information on lingcod in Mexico, Canada, and Alaska are provided in
the [Foreign Fisheries](foreign-fisheries) section of this report. 

In regards to spatial modeling new information on genetic differences between
north and south support the treatment of these areas as independent models.


The four **Unresolved Problems** were as follows:

1. The models did not use the available age data sampled from the 
  fishing fleets due to concerns that unsexed fish had been assigned equally 
  to the sexes without regard to length and because of evidence there had 
  been non-random subsampling of fish for age-reading.
  
2. The available age-readings had been done by at least two laboratories. 
  It was unclear that age-reading protocols had been employed consistently
  
3. In the northern model the STAT fixed the parameter for female length 
  at age 14 years because when this parameter was freely estimated the model 
  estimated asymptotic selection for the trawl fishery and greatly altered 
  the estimates of spawning biomass. It was unclear what data sources were 
  responsible for this result.
  
4. Sensitivity analyses for draft versions of both models indicated 
  they were sensitive to underlying structural assumptions such as the starting 
  year for recruitment deviations and which indices were included. Although 
  the revisions to the models developed during the STAR may have lessened the 
  sensitivity of the models by removing sources of tension and keeping the more 
  reliable data, there was not sufficient time during the review to explore the 
  sensitivity of the final base models.
  

All Unresolved Problems were addressed during this assessment.

Unresolved problem 1 was addressed for the north model by representing the 
age data as conditioned on length for sexed `r spp`. Unsexed age samples
were not included in either model. Length distributions of unsexed fish were
represented as independent vectors in addition to the vectors of
female and male compositions.

<!-- currently nwfscSurvey methodology does not include unsexed fish. This could be overcome
based on the create_caal_nonsurvey.R script. May wish to state here the amount of unsexed 
aged fish - and whether it was high or not. Regardless, sexed fish is a good start -->

Unresolved problem 2 was addressed by conducting additional analysis
on ageing error among readers. This is described in the
[Ageing Error](ageing-precision-and-bias) section of this report. The ages
available for the north model were fit reasonably well while those available
in the south model from sources other that \gls{s-wcgbt} showed a lack 
of fit that was unlikely to be attributable to ageing uncertainty.

Unresolved problem 3. The addition of more years of age data from
the \gls{s-wcgbt} along with the inclusion of ages from the fisheries
resulted in a total of 72,121 age samples represented in the north model
which were more than adequate to provide reasonable estimates of growth.

Unresolved problem 4 is a general issue of stock assessment modeling, 
and not unique to `r spp`. We explored a number of sensitivities 
excluding data sources and reconciling data conflicts.

The three **Major Uncertainties** were as follows:

1. Stock structure: Aspects of the length- and age-compositions evident 
  in the NWFSC survey data strongly indicate spatial patterns that probably 
  cannot be well mimicked with separate, independent models for the north and the south
  
2. Key productivity parameters: Neither the northern model nor the 
  southern model were able to estimate the steepness or the female natural 
  mortality parameters given the available data. Values for these key parameters 
  had to be fixed but there is very little knowledge to inform the choice of those 
  values. As such this is a source of considerable uncertainty. During review of 
  this report the STAT suggested that including the age-composition data in the 
  northern base model (data had been removed during the STAR) would allow estimation of M and h.
  
3. Habitat area, north versus south: The northern and southern base 
  models estimate appreciable differences in the unfished spawning biomass 
  of lingcod (37,974 mt in the north versus 20,462 mt in the south). It is 
  unknown whether such a difference is consistent with the habitat areas 
  suitable to support lingcod in the north versus the south.
  
All Major Uncertainties were explored during this assessment.

Research on `r spp` stock structure has been done since the last stock assessment
and provides evidence of a stock break in central California [@longo2020strong]. Details were 
described in the [Stock delineation](stock-delineation) section. Although this may
not resolve evidence of wide scale spatial patters, major Uncertainty 1 
can now be rexamined under additional information on stock structure. The 
data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} was, in general, well fit by both models.

Major Uncertainty 2 remains a source of uncertainty in the model. Stock-recruit 
steepness and natural mortality (for both females and males) were estimated
in both north and south models and provided plausible estimates. The representation
of the uncertainty in these estimates provides a better treatment of the 
uncertainty in quantities of interest, such as the management reference points.

Major Uncertainty 3 was addressed using simple assumptions on available habitat 
by assuming the relative difference in the amount of area in depths between 55m and 300m 
roughly approximates the relative difference in habitat area between modeled regions. 
<!-- TO DO: This is discussed in the context of our results. -->


The four general recommendations on stock assessments were as follows:

1. Modify the software used to develop length- and age-compositions from PacFIN data so that unsexed fish are flagged rather than including them in compositions after the automatic application of an assumed sex-ratio (e.g., 50:50). If the analysts preparing the composition data need to develop sex-ratio coefficients to accommodate unsexed fish (e.g., by length-bin), the assessment documents should clearly state the methods and data used for this purpose and the resulting sex-ratio coefficients.
  
2. If assessments use marginal age-compositions the STATs should evaluate whether the raw data are consistent with random sub-sampling from the available lengths. If the ages appear to have been subsampled non-randomly (e.g., no more than 5 fish from any length-bin), the age data should be suitably expanded to reflect the variable sampling fraction.
  
3. A standard approach for combining conditional age-at-length sample data into annual CAAL compositions should be developed and reviewed. If age data are not selected in proportion to the available lengths, simple aggregation of the ages by length-bin may provide biased views of the overall age-composition and year-class strength.
  
4. Comprehensively evaluate whether the Triennial survey should be split into early and late segments and the basis for making the decision. The lingcod assessment split the Triennial survey into separate early and late surveys, whereas there was a single Triennial survey in the draft assessment for Pacific ocean perch brought to this STAR.
  
Ongoing work by the NWFSC staff has addressed recommendations 1, 2, 3, and explorations 
by the `r spp` STAT can inform recommendation 4, though not comprehensively.
The `r spp` STAT chose to represent ages as conditioned on length rather than
apply an expansion to reverse the effect of non-random sampling.
