The sensitivity analyses were divided into three groups: biology and recruitment,
composition, indices, and selectivity
`r sprintf("(Tables \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s); Figures \\@ref(%s) - \\@ref(%s))", 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-bio-rec"), 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "tab:sens-table-s-sel"), 
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-bio-rec"),
string_switchletter(newletter = params$area, "fig:sens-timeseries-s-sel")
)`.

The biology and recruitment sensitivities included

- fix female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7 (values used in the 2017 assessment)
- fix female $M$ at 0.3
- fix $h$ at 0.7
- estimate a single $M$ for both sexes with a prior which is a mixture distribution 
of the two priors sex-specific priors in the base model 
(a lognormal with mean = 0.358, sd = 0.467)
- decrease $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.4
- increase $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.8

The composition sensitivities included

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- add all additional ages as CAAL to the south model
- add all additional ages as marginal
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- remove all fishery-dependent age data from the north model
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```

Additional composition-related sensitivities were conducted in earlier versions of
the model but were not repeated for the final base model.

The index sensitivities involved removing each index from the model as well
as removing all the fishery-dependent indices together.
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
Also included in the index sensitivities was changing the index associated with the
Oregon recreational fishery from one based on the ORBS sampling program to 
an alternative index developed from onboard CPFV observations.

```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
Also included in the index sensitivities was changing the index associated with the 
California recreational fishery in recent years from one based on the onboard CPFV 
observations to an alternative index developed from the CRFS sampling of private 
and rental boats.
```

The selectivity sensitivities included
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- make the fixed-gear fishery selectivity asymptotic rather than dome shaped
(in the north model it is estimated as asymptotic)
```
- allow sex-specific selectivity by adding for each fleet representing 
the difference between females and males in the height of the peak 
selectivity
- allow sex-specific selectivity as above while also fixing female $M$ = 0.3
- make retention in the early period equal to the recent period
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- make the scale and descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific 
for all fisheries selectivity but retain shared selectivity for females and males
in the surveys

Numerous additional sensitivities related to sex-specific selectivity
were conducted for the north model during the STAR review, 
none of which provided model results which were more plausible
than the chosen base model. See the STAR report for more detail on these
additional sensitivities.

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from the tables of sensitivity values -->
Among the biology and recruitment sensitivities,
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-n-bio-rec}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-n-bio-rec}),
the north model was 
most sensitive to the two where female $M$ was fixed at 0.3 with or
without also fixing $h = 0.7$ (compared to 
the base model with $M$ estimated at 0.42).
The lower $M$ pushed the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass down
slightly, but the lower productivity associated with these parameters 
meant that the catch history drove the stock below the 25\% minimum stock size 
threshold in the 1990s whereas the base model estimates that stock never
fell below that limit. The fraction unfished at the start of 2021 
was 32\% when $M = 0.3$ and $h = 0.7$ and 34\% when $h$ was estimated,
compared to 64\% in the base model. 
The negative log-likelihood for both sensitivities with $M = 0.3$ were about
17 units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits to all data sources with the exception of the age comps
which have an improvement in fit of about 12 units.

Among the composition sensitivities 
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-n-comp}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-n-comp}),
the north model was sensitive to removing the
fishery-dependent ages, which reduced the estimate of female $M$ from 0.42 to 0.33 
and pushed the scale upwards. Applying the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood 
for the composition data (which led to higher weights for these data) 
had the opposite effect, bringing the scale downwards. 
The two sensitivities related to combining male and female samples for 
small fish and excluding unsexed fish from the likelihood had relatively
little impact on the model results.

The sensitivities related to an alternative recreational Oregon index
or removing indices from the north model 
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-n-index}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-n-index})
also had relatively little impact with the exception of the one in which all 
fishery CPUE indices
were removed, which increased the scale from 64\% of $B_0$% in 2021 to 82\%.
The individual index which had the most influence, as measured by the impact
of it's removal, was the Washington recreational CPUE. This time series is
the longest among all indices and also spanned the period of greatest change
in estimated abundance.

The sensitivities related to selectivity
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-n-sel}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-n-sel})
showed large differences in
estimated $M$ and trends in abundance. However, the estimated selectivity
curves from these models showed implausibly large differences in 
selectivity at sizes which did not have any clear biological basis.
Furthermore, the choice of which selectivity parameters and/or time
blocks on which to apply the sex-specific differences made selecting among
these models difficult and risked overparameterization of the model.
One of these models was chosen for an alternative state of nature, and
further exploration of differences in selectivity or availability 
between females and males is a research priority for future assessments.

```

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
<!-- manual updates needed here if models change -->
<!-- values in paragraph below are from the tables of sensitivity values -->
The south model was sensitivity to many of the sensitivities related to 
biology and recruitment 
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-s-bio-rec}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-bio-rec}).
Those with biggest impact included increasing $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.8,
which brought the scale of the stock downard, with 2021 biomass below the 
minimum stock size threshold, while those in which $M$ was fixed at 0.3 
or shared among females and males (which led to an estimate of $M$ = 0.33)
all had 2021 fraction unfished greater than 90\% (compared to a base
model estimates of female $M$ = 0.17 and 2021 fraction unfished at 39\%).
The negative log-likelihood for the models with alternative assumptions
aboutn $M$ were 3 to 5 units units worse than the base 
model, with worse fits the index and length comp data and better fits to the age
compositions.

The south model was also sensitive to changes in composition data
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-s-comp}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-comp}). This is likely due to the 
smaller volume of composition data available for this model.
The addition of ages from all sources resulted in increases in estimated
abundance when the ages were conditioned on length, but a decrease
in estimated abundance when the ages were represented as marginal 
distributions. The Dirichlet-Multinomial
sensitivity, which led to increased weight on the length and age compositions
resulted in a lower estimate of female $M$ = 0.13 and pushed 2021 fraction
unfished up to 0.83.

Anong the sensitivities related to changing or removing indices
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-s-index}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-index}),
removing all fishery-dependent indices had the largest impact, resulting
in an estimated fraction unfished that never fell below 50\%, suggesting
that the fishery-dependent indices provide important information
abound historical changes in abundance.
The individual indices whose removal had the largest impact were
those related to the historical indices: the \gls{s-tri} and 
the recreational CPFV Deb Wilson-Vandenberg index. Also, 
changing the California recreational indices for the recent period from
one based on the onboard CPFV observations to an alternative developed 
from the CRFS sampling of private and rental boats reduced the estimated
population significantly.

The sensitivities related to selectivity
(Table \ref{tab:sens-table-s-sel}, 
Figure \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-sel}),
showed that forcing the fixed-gear fishery to be asymptotic reduced the 
estimated population size by removing the estimated cryptic biomass
of larger individuals unavailable to any fishery. In contrast, a model
with sex-specific selectivity had much higher initial abundance but 
lower productivity, ending below the base model at the end of the time series.
Combining sex-specific selectivity with fixing female $M$ = 0.3, resulted in 
the sensitivity which was most similar to the base model.

```

A final note on the sensitivities is that convergence issues associated
with selectivity parameters hitting bounds, which were resolved for the 
base model, have the potential to impact some of the sensitivity analyses 
which could not be examined as carefully as the base or alternative
candidate base models which were considered during the model selection 
process.
