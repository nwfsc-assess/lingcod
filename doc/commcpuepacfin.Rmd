#### PacFIN trawl logbook index

A commercial trawl \gls{cpue} index was retained from the previous assessment.
The index spans the years 1981-1997,
ending before the 1998 changes in management
(Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets)).
A detailed description of the standardization approach is available in 
Haltuch et al. [-@haltuch2019lingcod].
As in the last assessment, the coastwide estimates were post-stratified to produce separate indices for each stock.
For this assessment,
the stratification was updated to reflect the new boundary at \CapeM
without changing the underlying index standardization
(pers. comm., J. Wallace, \gls{nwfsc}).
