<!-- Most recent STAR panel and SSC recommendations -->
<!-- cite star report -->
The 2017 STAR report noted four unresolved problems and
three major sources of uncertainty
as well as provided three specific recommendations for future research
with respect to `r spp` [@haltuch2019lingcod].
In addition, the Panel made four recommendations for stock assessments in general.

All four **unresolved problems** were addressed during this assessment.

1. **The models did not use the available age data sampled from the 
  fishing fleets due to concerns that unsexed fish had been assigned equally 
  to the sexes without regard to length and because of evidence there had 
  been non-random subsampling of fish for age-reading.**

Age data included in the northern model were conditioned on length for sexed `r spp`.
Unsexed age samples were not included in either model.
Length distributions of unsexed fish were represented as independent vectors
in addition to the vectors of female and male compositions.

<!-- nwfscSurvey methodology does not include unsexed fish. This could be overcome
based on the create_caal_nonsurvey.R script. May wish to state here the amount of unsexed 
aged fish - and whether it was high or not.-->

2. **The available age-readings had been done by at least two laboratories. 
  It was unclear that age-reading protocols had been employed consistently.**

Analyses on ageing error did not show differences between readers, labs, or cohorts (see Section \@ref(ageing-precision-and-bias)).
The ages available for the north model were fit reasonably well while those available
in the south from sources other than \gls{s-wcgbt} showed a lack 
of fit that was unlikely attributable to ageing uncertainty alone.

3. **In the northern model the STAT fixed the parameter for female length 
  at age 14 years because when this parameter was freely estimated the model 
  estimated asymptotic selection for the trawl fishery and greatly altered 
  the estimates of spawning biomass. It was unclear what data sources were 
  responsible for this result.**

The addition of more years of age data from
the \gls{s-wcgbt} along with the inclusion of ages from the fisheries
resulted in a total of 72,121 age samples represented in the north model
which was more than adequate to provide reasonable estimates of growth.

4. **Sensitivity analyses for draft versions of both models indicated 
  they were sensitive to underlying structural assumptions such as the starting 
  year for recruitment deviations and which indices were included. Although 
  the revisions to the models developed during the STAR may have lessened the 
  sensitivity of the models by removing sources of tension and keeping the more 
  reliable data, there was not sufficient time during the review to explore the 
  sensitivity of the final base models.**

A number of sensitivities were explored that
excluded data sources and attempted to reconcile data conflicts.
Additional explorations made during the STAR panel review led to
changing the timing of the main recruitment period in the southern model
given removal of the early length data that had small sample sizes and
were only representative of a small portion of the coast.
Sensitivity to underlying structural assumptions is a general issue of stock assessment modeling
and not unique to `r spp`. 

All three **major uncertainties** were explored during this assessment.

1. **Stock structure: Aspects of the length- and age-compositions evident 
  in the NWFSC survey data strongly indicate spatial patterns that probably 
  cannot be well mimicked with separate, independent models for the north and the south.**

Research on `r spp` stock structure that was completed since the last stock assessment
provided evidence of a stock break in central California [@longo2020strong]. Details were 
described in the [Stock delineation](stock-delineation) section. Although this may
not resolve evidence of wide scale spatial patters, major Uncertainty 1 
can now be rexamined under additional information on stock structure. The 
data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} was, in general, well fit by both models.

2. **Key productivity parameters: Neither the northern model nor the 
  southern model were able to estimate the steepness or the female natural 
  mortality parameters given the available data. Values for these key parameters 
  had to be fixed but there is very little knowledge to inform the choice of those 
  values. As such this is a source of considerable uncertainty. During review of 
  this report the STAT suggested that including the age-composition data in the 
  northern base model (data had been removed during the STAR) would allow estimation of M and h.**

Stock-recruit steepness and natural mortality (for both females and males) were estimated
in both north and south models and provided plausible estimates. The representation
of the uncertainty in these estimates provides a better treatment of the 
uncertainty in quantities of interest, such as the management reference points.

3. **Habitat area, north versus south: The northern and southern base 
  models estimate appreciable differences in the unfished spawning biomass 
  of `r spp` (37,974 mt in the north versus 20,462 mt in the south). It is 
  unknown whether such a difference is consistent with the habitat areas 
  suitable to support `r spp` in the north versus the south.**

Using simple assumptions on available habitat,
by assuming the relative difference in the amount of area in depths between 55 m and 300 m,
roughly approximates the relative difference in habitat area between modeled regions. 
<!-- TO DO: This is discussed in the context of our results. -->

Next, we provide responses to each of the
three **specific recommendations** from the 2017 STAR panel.

1. **There should be a study to cross-validate age-readings of `r spp`
  among the different laboratories contributing age data to the assessment.
  It may be necessary to develop laboratory-specific (and possibly year-specific)
  ageing-error vectors.**

Additional ageing comparisons were conducted and the ageing uncertainty was
re-estimated as described in the
[Ageing Error](ageing-precision-and-bias) section of this report.
However, the new estimates showed similar uncertainty in ageing to the previous assessment.
The differences among age distributions within the same length bins among sources available for the southern model
are large enough that they are unlikely due to uncertainty in ageing alone.
Removing all ages in the southern model other than those from the \gls{s-wcgbt} resolved this issue.

2. **Available information on `r spp` catches, abundance trends, and
  age-compositions should be acquired from Canadian and Mexican authorities
  to take an initial step towards a more spatially-comprehensive view of `r spp`
  population trends and dynamics.**

Additional information on `r spp` in Mexico, Canada, and Alaska is provided in the
[Foreign Fisheries](foreign-fisheries) section of this report.

3. **The next iteration of this assessment could be an update assessment.
  If a full assessment is done it should explore developing a spatial model
  that encompasses the northern and southern areas rather than again treating
  them as independent stocks, as in the current and previous assessments.**

New information on genetic differences between the modeled areas
supports the treatment of these areas as independent models
(see Section \@ref(stock-delineation)).
A spatially-explicit model encompassing data from both stocks was not investigated for this assessment because
the widespread use of such approaches are not yet standard and remain operational for only a few select data-rich stocks,
largely in a simulation context.
Limitations still exist because of the model complexity associated with increasing spatiotemporal dimensions,
including underlying data limitations,
confronting the expanding number of decisions or assumptions that need to be made, and
the amount of analyst time required to develop, test, and vet spatial procedures given production stock assessment timelines
[@10.1093/icesjms/fsaa203; @10.1016/j.fishres.2019.01.014].
Scientifically, there is growing appreciation and application of spatial stock assessment methods using simulations and
the results of this research underlines the importance of acknowledging spatial processes
(e.g., connectivity dynamics between unique segments of a stock;
biological characteristics that change across environmental gradients; and
regulations that impose local changes in fishing patterns)
across the management domain
[@10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105608; @10.1093/icesjms/fsaa203].
But, a production-level spatially-explicit stock assessment framework was not available for this assessment.

The four general recommendations on stock assessments were as follows:

1. Modify the software used to develop length- and age-compositions from PacFIN data so that unsexed fish are flagged rather than including them in compositions after the automatic application of an assumed sex-ratio (e.g., 50:50). If the analysts preparing the composition data need to develop sex-ratio coefficients to accommodate unsexed fish (e.g., by length-bin), the assessment documents should clearly state the methods and data used for this purpose and the resulting sex-ratio coefficients.
  
2. If assessments use marginal age-compositions the STATs should evaluate whether the raw data are consistent with random sub-sampling from the available lengths. If the ages appear to have been subsampled non-randomly (e.g., no more than 5 fish from any length-bin), the age data should be suitably expanded to reflect the variable sampling fraction.
  
3. A standard approach for combining conditional age-at-length sample data into annual CAAL compositions should be developed and reviewed. If age data are not selected in proportion to the available lengths, simple aggregation of the ages by length-bin may provide biased views of the overall age-composition and year-class strength.
  
4. Comprehensively evaluate whether the Triennial survey should be split into early and late segments and the basis for making the decision. The `r spp` assessment split the Triennial survey into separate early and late surveys, whereas there was a single Triennial survey in the draft assessment for Pacific ocean perch brought to this STAR.
  
Ongoing work by the NWFSC staff has addressed recommendations 1, 2, 3, and explorations 
by the `r spp` STAT can inform recommendation 4, though not comprehensively.
The `r spp` STAT chose to represent ages as conditioned on length rather than
apply an expansion to reverse the effect of non-random sampling.
